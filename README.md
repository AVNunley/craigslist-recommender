# craigslist-recommender

This repository hosts a recommendation engine for craigslist ads. This tool will help users of the site discover listings of interest to them with less effort.

## Dataset

The dataset used to build the tool will be Harvard's "Craigslist Postings in Massachusetts" which can be found here:

https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/52WSPT

This dataset contains housing listings for Massachusetts that were active on the site from 04/26/2020 through 01/18/2020.

The tool will eventually rely on snapshots of current listings for all items and services available on the site.
