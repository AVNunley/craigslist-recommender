## Dataset

The dataset currently being used to build the tool is Harvard's "Craigslist Postings in Massachusetts" which can be found here:

https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/52WSPT

This dataset contains housing listings for Massachusetts that were active on the site from 04/26/2020 through 01/18/2020.

The tool will eventually rely on snapshots of current listings for all items and services available on the site.

## Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciKit-Learn
- Gensim
- NLTK
- Scipy

## To Do

Now:

Recommendations based on unsupervised ML algorithms

Later:

Scrape and wrangle current listing data
